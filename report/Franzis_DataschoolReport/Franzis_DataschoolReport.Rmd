# Introduction
I work in CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere on deep-sea observational data from the outer continental shelf and the continental slope. 

# My Project
My current project is analysing still images of the seafloor on seamounts south of Tasmania, collected using a towed camera system. The images are annotated for (1) percent cover of substrate types, including non-biotic rocks, sediments etc and a matrix forming stony coral, distinguished into live and dead fractions; and (2) for density (number of individuals per m^2^) of taxa considered indicators for vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs).

## Preliminary results

In total 6100 images have been selected for annotation which is done in separate software and still ongoing. To date `r nrow(PCcoverbyImage)` images have been annotated for percent cover of substrate types, `r nrow(VMEannoMatrix)` have been annotated for VME taxa. 

Combinig the percent cover and density data into a by-image data metrix is a useful output for taking the data into QGIS for mapping visualisations.

QGIS is my preferred tool for creating maps because it allows for interactive zooming.

The distribution of the live and dead coral matrix formed by Solenosmilia variabilis_ (coded as SC_SOL and SU_SOL) is of particular interest, because this coral is a structural engineer forming biogenic habitats that are particularly vulnerable to impacts by demersal trawling.  

```{r MyFig1,  out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Depth distribution of (A) all substrate types  and (B) individual depth distribution of the percent cover of live (SC_SOL) and dead (SU_SOL) coral matrix"}
#distribution of the substrate types
# create a vector with the sequence of the substrate types for ordering them in a meaningful way
SubstSeq <- c('SC-ENLP',
              'SU-ENLP',
              'SC-SOL',
              'SU-SOL',
              'SC-MAD',
              'SU-MAD',
              'SU-BCOR',
              'SU-BBAR',
              'SU-BOTH',
              'SU-ROK',
              'SU-BOL',
              'SU-COB',
              'SU-CONBIO',
              'SU-PEBGRAV',
              'SU-SAMU',
              'NS')
Plot1 <- ggplot(PC_cover,
       mapping= aes(x=factor(L2_Code, level =SubstSeq),              #call the pre existing vector
                    y=depth,
                    size=PC_cover)
  )+
  geom_point(alpha=0.1)+
  scale_y_reverse() +                            # reverse y-axis because it represents ocean depth 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+   # rotate the label on x-axis
  labs(x="substrate type", y="depth")


Plot2 <- PC_cover %>% 
  filter(L2_Code == "SC-SOL" |
         L2_Code == "SU-SOL"  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = depth,
             y = PC_cover))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.2)+
  facet_wrap(~L2_Code)

plot_grid(Plot1, Plot2, ncol=1, labels = c('A', 'B'))

```

```{r MyFig2,  out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.height= 2, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Frequency distrbution histograms of % cover recorded for coral matrix and rubble"}

CoralPC <- PC_cover %>% 
  filter(L2_Code == "SC-SOL" |
         L2_Code == "SU-SOL" )

CoralPC %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = PC_cover)) +
  facet_wrap(~ L2_Code) +
  geom_histogram()
```

The depth distribution of the coral matrix is clearly limited to between ~800 and ~1600m depth, with the live corals limited to ~900 to 1300m (Figure \@ref(fig:MyFig1)0. The percent cover of live coral is mostly below 25% while dead coral regularly reaches 100% coverage (Figure \@ref(fig:MyFig2)).

The density data distribution shows the typical 

```{r MyFig3, fig.align='center', fig.height= 4, fig.width=6,  fig.cap="**Frequency distribution of total density of VME taxa only "}
# looking at the distribution of density and number of taxa over the whole data set note non-VME taxa are commented out

VMEonly_TotDens %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = VMEtaxaDens))+
  geom_histogram()

# My Digital Toolbox

Through data school I have developed scripts using R Tidyverse to automate reading, tidying up and quality checking the data extracts from SQL queries in the ORACLE databae and from direct software outputs.

MarkDown is a useful tool for presenting data summaries and initial plot and analyses to collaborators.


# My time went

What parts of the project took the most time and effort? Were there any surprising challenges you
encountered, and how did you solve them?

# Next steps

What further steps do you wish your project could take? Or are there any new digital skills that you
are keen to develop as a result of your involvement in the Data School?

# My Data School Experience

This poster is mostly about your synthesis project. However we would also like to hear about other
parts of your Data School experience. What aspects of the program did you really enjoy? How have you
been applying the skills you have learned in your daily work? Have you been able to transfer this 
knowledge to your team members? Concrete examples demonstrating this would be useful here
(meetings/talks/collaborations/new roles). Any descriptions of the personal impact the program has 
had are welcome here as well!
